### Reddit Launch Post

**Title:** [Launch] CryptoSwap - Multi-Chain DEX Aggregator with 0.05% Fees

**Body:**
```markdown
Hey r/CryptoCurrency! 👋

I'm excited to announce the launch of **CryptoSwap**, a DEX aggregator I've been working on.

## What is CryptoSwap?

CryptoSwap finds the best prices across multiple DEXes (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, etc.) so you don't have to hunt for deals yourself. Think of it as a "Kayak" for crypto trading.

## Key Features:

- ⛓️ **6 Chains**: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, SEI
- 💰 **Low Fees**: Just 0.05% (vs 0.3%+ on most DEXes)
- 🔒 **Non-Custodial**: We never hold your funds
- ⚡ **Fast**: Instant price comparison and execution
- 🎨 **Clean UI**: Built on Pancake frontend (familiar, tested)

## Why I Built This:

I was tired of:
- Checking prices on 5 different DEXes
- Overpaying in fees
- Dealing with slow, buggy interfaces
- Getting slippage surprises

So I built a better solution.

## How It Works:

1. Connect your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
2. Choose tokens to swap
3. We find the best price across all DEXes
4. Execute in one click
5. Done!

## Try It:

🌐 **https://cryptoswap.com**

## No VC Funding, No Token, No BS

This is a simple, honest project:
- We charge 0.05% per swap
- That's our entire business model
- No token launch
- No "tokenomics"
- Just a useful tool

## Feedback Welcome!

This is day 1. I'd love to hear:
- What you like
- What needs improvement
- What features you want
- Any bugs you find

Let's make DEX trading better together! 🚀

*P.S. We're not perfect yet. This is v1.0. Your feedback will shape v2.0!*

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CryptoSwap Launches Multi-Chain DEX Aggregator with Industry-Low 0.05% Fees

[CITY, STATE] - [DATE] - CryptoSwap, a next-generation decentralized exchange aggregator, officially launched today, offering traders the best prices across six major blockchain networks.

The platform addresses a common pain point in decentralized finance: finding the best swap prices across multiple DEXes. CryptoSwap automatically searches Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Trader Joe, and other leading DEXes to ensure users get optimal pricing on every trade.

"DEX trading shouldn't require a Ph.D. in DeFi," said [Your Name], Founder of CryptoSwap. "We built CryptoSwap to make finding the best prices effortless. Just connect your wallet and trade—we handle the rest."

Key Features:
- Multi-chain support: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and SEI
- Industry-low 0.05% platform fee
- Non-custodial architecture ensures users maintain full control of their assets
- Clean, intuitive interface built on battle-tested technology

Unlike traditional DEXes that require users to provide liquidity, CryptoSwap operates as a pure aggregator, routing trades through existing liquidity pools to ensure optimal pricing and execution.

The platform is live at https://cryptoswap.com

About CryptoSwap:
CryptoSwap is a decentralized exchange aggregator that provides users with the best crypto trading prices across multiple blockchain networks. By aggregating liquidity from leading DEXes, CryptoSwap ensures optimal execution for every trade.
